I need you to detect the API misuse in my dataset. I will send you fixed version and buggy version of the code, tell me if there is API misuse or not. Provide your answer as in following format:
1. If there are API misuses, response YES, otherwise say NO
2. If the previous question is YES, then give me the API Misuse line number. If the previous question is NO, then leave it blank
